   	      <h3>Sheraton Kauai Resort</h3>
		  <p>
          <p>Set amidst 20 acres of lush oceanfront gardens, Sheraton Kauai is located on the island's favorite beach at Po'ipu.  I love the feel of this resort.  It has lots to offer, but is also casual, comfortable, and laid back.  Upon arrival you will be greeted with a lei.
            There are lots of activities at the resort to choose from. Learn the art of the hula or  make a lei.   Fantastic snorkeling is just a short walk down the beach.  You might even spot a seal sunning himself on the beach outside your balcony.
          The sunsets are breathtaking, and Sheraton offers  nightly entertainment with a torch-lighting ceremony, luau and complimentary mai tais.If budget is an issue, I also really liked the peace and tranquility of the garden-view rooms at the Sheraton Kauai.</p>
