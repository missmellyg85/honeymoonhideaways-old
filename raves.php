                  <p>"I am ready to go again next week!  The tourist traffic was low, the service was fantastic, loved the location of the hotel, and we received a free breakfast as a perk.  The only thing I would have changed was the amount of time I spent there - maybe another two weeks!  Thanks for setting it up.  You can be sure we will return."

                  <p>"We loved Playa and the Royal blew every other hotel we have been to away.  The hotel was lovely, the grounds are beautiful, and the room was just awesome.  The service was impeccable.  Our maid and beach butler were beyond kind and professional.  I wish they could come live with me!  We actually plan on going back to the Royal next year, if the economy permits.  We might try Cancun or was may just go back to Playa and stay in an Ocean Front room (they were breathtaking).  Vicki thank you so much for all your help; we fellt much better leaving the states knowing you would help if we needed it.&quot; Tammy and Tim</p>

                  <p>"Now that we are bck in the "grind" of normal life, it seems like a dream that we were at Sandals just last month.  This was our first trip to Jamaica.  We were so impressed with the island and the Sandals experience.  We are certain that you helped us choose the BEST island and the BEST Sandals location.  The staff was excellent, the food was fantastic; the entertainment was amazing!  We hope to come back soon."

                  <p>&quot;Our stay at Royal Plantation was probably the best vacation we have been on yet.  Both of us have been on cruises and stayed at many other hotels in the Caribbean and Hawaii, but this place was wonderful.  The service, food and amenities were awesome.  We would definitely revisit.  Thanks for all your help.&quot;
