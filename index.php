                <div class="quoteB"><p>"I am ready to go again next week!  The tourist traffic was low, the service was fantastic, loved the location of the hotel, and we received a free breakfast as a perk.  The only thing I would have changed was the amount of time I spent there - maybe another two weeks!  Thanks for setting it up.  You can be sure we will return."
